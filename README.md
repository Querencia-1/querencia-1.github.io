Querencia is a youth-led psychology initiative aimed at making mental health services more accessible and fun. We at querencia aim to bridge the gap between theoretical psychology and real life requirements and in turn reducing the taboo around mental health. The word “Querencia” means  a place like home where one feels strongest and at peace.
